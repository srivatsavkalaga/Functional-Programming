Imperative vs Functional programming

Here are the important points:

- Imperative programming 
  - Modeled as a sequence of commands (imperatives) that modify state.
  - A traditional for loop is an example: it sets an initial state and modifies it through commands in each iteration.

- Functional programming 
  - Describes programs as expressions and transformations, avoiding mutable state.
  - Models problems like mathematical formulas, focusing on higher-order functions.
  - Uses functions (e.g., `filter`, `map`) to represent transformations, allowing developers to customize logic by passing functions as parameters.
